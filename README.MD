# Gosper's Hack

## Introduction

This repository contains the implementation of Gosper's Hack algorithm, a technique for generating combinations with k set bits in an n-bit word.

## Class: `GospersHack`

The `GospersHack` class provides a method named `Implementation` for generating combinations.

### Method Signature:

```cpp
int Implementation(int k, int n);
```

### Method Description:

`k`: Number of set bits in each combination.<br>
`n`: Total number of bits in each combination.
